#  BMI Calculator

## Description
This app calculates your BMI (Body Mass Index). Based on the user’s height and weight, their BMI is calculated and a piece of advice is given, either to gain weight or to lose weight.

I created this app as part of the [App Brewery's "Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp'' course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/).

Building on the lessons from the previous module [Quizzler](https://github.com/cervania-aldrich/Quizzler), I revisit the MVC pattern but also build on my knowledge of structures by understanding classes and inheritance. Additionally, this module is where we were introduced to the various ways of dealing with optionals such as optional binding, and what building multi-screen applications is like using segues.

I am particularly proud of building this app because I have innovated on top of the app to make it more unique by adding a feature where the user can calculate their BMI using metric measurements or imperial measurements, thus developing my confidence and problem solving skills. 

As this app was made for learning purposes, I have added many comments and documentation markup in order to be as descriptive as possible. It has been an effective learning strategy for me. I found this has helped me understand the Swift language and the Apple Developer documentation better. Also, it helped me not fall into the trap of just copying code from a tutorial, rather I’m reassuring myself that I actually understand the code being written and why it was written. Furthermore, I recognise that documenting code is an important skill to have as a Software Developer, and I believe it is worth practising.

## Instructions
Clone this repository in Xcode to run the project. Run it in the simulator.

Use the sliders to set your height and weight in cm and kg respectively. Then press the calculate button to receive your BMI result.

## Learning Objectives
What did I learn? How did this app improve my iOS development skills?

There are several concepts that I was able to learn whilst developing this app. This includes:

* Learn about methods of dealing with optionals, including force unwrapping, optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
* Learn about Swift Classes.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming and Inheritance.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types.
* Learn about the UISlider
* Learn how to create a custom UIViewController class.
* Create UI programmatically without the Interface Builder.
* Use segues to build a multi-screen app.

## What makes this project stand out?
To improve my understanding, I added extra features to the app. This includes:

* Add a switch to allow the user to calculate their BMI using metric or imperial measurements.
* Add another UISlider should the user calculate their BMI with imperial measurements.
* Add rounded corners for the Calculate button.
* Refactor the code with functions for improved readability.
* Add comments to help explain my code.
* Use the DocC framework to add Swift documentation to guide end-users reviewing the code.
